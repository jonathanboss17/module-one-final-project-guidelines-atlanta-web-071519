#####  What is DreamJot?  

The purpose of DreamJot is to provide the user a convenient and organized location to store places that they want to visit as well as things they might want to do when they’re there.   Users can then return to the app to pull all of their dreamed-of destinations. 

##### Instructions for using the app

A user can launch the app by cloning or downloading the program files and executing `ruby bin/run.rb` from inside the project directory.  Upon launching the app, the user will be asked for their username.  After logging in, the user can go to the main menu to interact with their jots.  

If a user does not have a username yet, they will be prompted to create one.  After which, they have the choice to go back to the main menu to begin creating jots.  

Once at the main menu, a user can create, edit, or delete jots, and view all destinations associated with their jots.  The user also has the option to view information about DreamJot or to simply exit the application.  

###### Creating jots 

To create a jot, simply enter the number (1) associated with the ‘Jot something’ option, upon which a series of prompts will guide you through the process. The user will first be asked to enter a city, then  state (or country). Next, the user will be asked to create their jot or, in other words, ‘jot something down.’ After the jot has been created, the user will then be asked to either return to the main menu, or exit the app. 

###### Viewing current jots 

Selecting “View current jots” will return to the user all the currently saved destinations.  

###### Editing a jot

Editing a jot is easy.  The user again will be guided through prompts asking what they want the jot to say.  After they’re done, the user will receive a message with the requested changes and asking whether they want to make changes.  If a user wants to make changes, they can choose to do so, or they can back to main menu.  

###### Deleting jots

When a user opts to delete a jot, they will receive a list of all of their jots.  They can then select the jot they wish to delete.  After the jot is successfully deleted, the user can return to the main menu or exit the app.   

###### Viewing current destinations 

Selecting “View your current destinations” will return to the user all the currently saved destinations.
